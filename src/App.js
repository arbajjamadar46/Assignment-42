        Pune is a vibrant city in India known for its rich history, educational institutions, and thriving tech industry. It offers a mix of historical landmarks, delicious cuisine, and scenic beauty.Pune, being a pivotal city in the IT park of southern India, is often mistaken as a modern establishment. Indeed, the town has grown a lot, both economically and commercially. With advancements in different sectors and the emerging IT park, people from around the country have settled here to start a new life. But Pune is not coined as the Queen of Deccan just because of its economic or industrial status. Instead, the city is considered the hub of cultural and historical riches of Maharashtra that cannot be found anywhere else. Founded back in the 17th century, it has stood witness to several turning points and events.
